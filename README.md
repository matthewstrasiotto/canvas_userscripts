# canvas_userscripts


## project_groups

This script mainly just "stickies" the "Unassigned Students" column/searchbar,
so that it doesn't scroll off-page as you scroll through the groups.

This allows you to scroll to a given group, search up each student in that group,
and then drag & drop them into the correct group without needing to scroll back and forth to find the student, then find the group.
